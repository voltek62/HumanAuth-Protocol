## Overview 📜  
The **HumanAuth Protocol** is a decentralized, privacy-focused framework designed to differentiate human users from AI agents on the web. By combining behavioral biometrics, decentralized identity verification, and AI transparency mechanisms, it aims to restore trust in online interactions while enabling ethical AI collaboration.  

---

## Features ✨  

### 1. **Dynamic Behavioral Biometrics Layer**  
   - Analyzes micro-interactions (mouse movements, keystrokes, scroll patterns) in real-time using lightweight ML models.  
   - Deploys randomized "human challenges" (e.g., tracing a curve) to disrupt automated scripts.  

### 2. **Decentralized Proof of Humanity (PoH)**  
   - Integrates with privacy-first identity systems (e.g., Worldcoin, BrightID) to verify humanity without collecting personal data.  
   - Issues non-transferable **Humanity NFTs** (ERC-721) to authenticate sensitive actions (e.g., voting, purchases).  

### 3. **AI Transparency & Ethical API Gateway**  
   - Mandates AI agents to declare themselves via HTTP headers (e.g., `X-AI-Agent: GPT-5; Purpose=Research`).  
   - Provides a dedicated API for ethical AI interactions, with micro-payments (crypto) for service access.  

### 4. **Public Action Ledger**  
   - Logs all automated actions on an Ethereum-based blockchain for transparency and auditability.

## Key Technologies 🛠️  
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)**: For client-side behavioral analysis with near-zero latency.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)**: To prove humanity without revealing identity.  
- **Lightweight Neural Networks**: Browser-compatible models for AI detection.  
- **IPFS**: Stores anonymized behavioral templates off-chain.  

---

## Getting Started 🚀  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js v18+  
- MetaMask (for PoH Wallet integration)  

### Installation  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/humanweb-protocol.git  
cd humanweb-protocol  
npm install  
npm run build  
```
